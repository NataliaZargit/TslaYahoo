THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL COMMUNITY SENTIMENTS ON HIGH-TECH COMPANY STOCK PRICE (TESLA, INC.)
In modern financial markets, investor behaviour is increasingly influenced by online discussions and sentiment shared across digital platforms. For high-technology companies, market volatility is shaped not only by financial performance but also by the collective opinions and emotions of the financial community. This project investigates the relationship between online financial sentiment and stock price movements by analysing user-generated discussion data from Yahoo Finance alongside historical stock market data for Tesla (TSLA).
The project follows the CRISP-DM methodology and applies a data-driven approach combining web scraping, data preprocessing, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques. Yahoo Finance discussion comments were collected and preprocessed using standard NLP methods. Community-provided BULLISH, BEARISH, and NEUTRAL labels were used to frame a supervised sentiment (stance) classification task. Baseline sentiment models, including VADER and FinBERT, were evaluated but showed limited ability to capture investor-oriented sentiment. To address this limitation, a supervised machine learning model based on TF–IDF features and Logistic Regression was developed, with additional techniques applied to handle class imbalance. 
The results demonstrate that the supervised stance classification model provides more reliable and balanced label predictions than baseline sentiment approaches. The trained model was applied to unlabelled discussion data to construct a sentiment-labelled dataset covering approximately one year of Yahoo Finance discussions, combining both community-provided and model-predicted investor stance. Daily aggregated sentiment indicators were aligned with historical stock price data for Tesla (TSLA), and correlation analysis and time-series modelling were used to examine both contemporaneous and lagged relationships between sentiment and stock price movements.
